Dear Dr Kapov:

Many thanks for the reply, I am very pleased you are able to accept. 
Attached is some guidance about how to prepare for your talk.  As you will see from the 
memo (file named "memo for Dr Karpov.doc", the idea is that you provide an overview of the 
area and place the other two talks in perspective. This means we will need to co-ordinate 
the talks from the other speakers with yours (the instructions for the session speakers is 
also attached for your information).  We will set a time by when the other speakers will need 
to complete drafts of their talks and then send them to you. I would expect this to 
be in late January early Feb.

I hope this (and the attached documents) answers your questions.  
If not, then please do let me know and I will try and answer them

My very best wishes

Jon
